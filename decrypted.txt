once upon a time there was a lovely
princess. but she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort which could
only be broken by love's first kiss.
she was locked away in a castle guarded
by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison,
but non prevailed. she waited in the
dragon's keep in the highest room of
the tallest tower for her true love
and true love's first kiss. (laughs)
like that's ever gonna happen. what
a load of - (toilet flush).
